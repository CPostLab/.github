# 🧬 Post Lab

Welcome to the official GitHub organization of **Post Lab**!

We investigate the **internal dynamics, energetics, and intermolecular interactions of proteins** to better understand and manipulate their biological functions. Our research combines **solution NMR spectroscopy** and **molecular dynamics simulations** to probe protein systems at both macroscopic and microscopic levels.

## 🔍 Research Focus

- Regulation of **protein tyrosine kinase** activity in signal transduction  
- **Virus capsid dynamics**  
- Mechanisms of **α-synuclein aggregation**
